# SentimentAnalysis
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece of text.
It involves analyzing text to identify whether the expressed sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. 
Stopwords are common words in a language that are often removed from text during various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis. 
These words are considered to be of little value in determining the overall sentiment of a piece of text because they are frequently used and don't carry significant meaning on their own. 
Stopwords include words like "and," "the," "is," "in," "of," and so on.
